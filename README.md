Sudoku game

There are two files, SudokuBoardCreator.py and SodukoGame.py. 
The SudokuBoardCreator will create boards and store them in a csv file. 
To be able to run the SudokuGame.py you first need to run the board creator and at least create one board. 
The board creator will create the third necessary board file if it doesn't exist.
